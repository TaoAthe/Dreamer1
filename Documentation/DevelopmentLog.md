# Dreamer C++ IDE Plugin Development Log

## Overview
This document tracks the development progress of the Dreamer C++ IDE plugin for Unreal Engine. The plugin aims to provide an integrated C++ development environment directly within the Unreal Editor, similar to Blueprint editing capabilities.

## Development Timeline

### 2023-07-05: Initial Implementation

#### Core Features Implemented
- Created basic plugin structure and descriptor (`Dreamer.uplugin`)
- Implemented main module files (`DreamerModule.h/cpp`)
- Added UI styling and command definitions (`DreamerStyle.h/cpp`, `DreamerCommands.h/cpp`)
- Created the C++ editor widget with file browser and text editor (`DreamerCodeEditor.h/cpp`)
- Implemented C++ syntax highlighting with custom coloring for different code elements
- Added file system integration for browsing, opening, and saving files
- Created basic toolbar with refresh and save functionality

#### Technical Details
- The C++ editor is implemented as a dockable tab within the Unreal Editor
- File browser shows all C++ files in the project and plugins directories
- Syntax highlighting supports keywords, types, comments, strings, numbers, and preprocessor directives
- Files can be opened for editing and saved back to disk

#### GitHub Repository
- Initialized Git repository
- Committed initial implementation
- Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/TaoAthe/Dreamer1.git

### 2023-07-06: Build System Integration

#### Core Features Implemented
- Added build management functionality (`BuildManager.h/cpp`)
- Created build error representation (`BuildError.h`)
- Implemented build error list widget (`BuildErrorList.h/cpp`)
- Added build toolbar with build, cancel, and error list buttons
- Implemented error highlighting in the code editor
- Connected to Unreal's build system for compilation

#### Technical Details
- Build process uses Unreal's build tools to compile code
- Build output is parsed to extract errors and warnings
- Error list shows file, line, and error message for each issue
- Error highlighting shows errors directly in the code editor
- Build progress is displayed with a progress bar
- Notifications show build success or failure

#### Next Steps Planned
1. **Intellisense Features**
   - Implement basic code completion
   - Add error highlighting as you type
   - Provide hover information

2. **Debugging Support**
   - Add breakpoint functionality
   - Connect to debugging infrastructure
   - Implement variable watches

3. **Code Navigation**
   - Implement "Go to Definition"
   - Add "Find All References"
   - Create symbol navigation

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Add multi-tab support
   - Implement find/replace
   - Add line numbering and code folding

## Technical Notes

### Plugin Architecture
The plugin is structured as follows:
- `Dreamer.uplugin`: Plugin descriptor
- `Source/Dreamer/`: Source code directory
  - `Public/`: Header files
  - `Private/`: Implementation files
  - `Dreamer.Build.cs`: Module build configuration

### C++ Syntax Highlighting
Custom syntax highlighting is implemented through a custom `FCppSyntaxHighlighter` class that extends `FSyntaxHighlighterTextLayoutMarshaller`. The highlighter supports:
- Keywords (blue)
- Types (green)
- Comments (gray)
- Strings (red)
- Numbers (orange)
- Preprocessor directives (purple)

### Build System Integration
The build system integration works by:
- Connecting to Unreal's build tools
- Parsing build output for errors and warnings
- Displaying errors in a dedicated error list panel
- Highlighting errors in the code editor
- Providing build progress feedback

### File System Integration
The plugin scans the project's Source directory and all plugin Source directories to build a hierarchical file tree. Files are grouped by directory and module.

### UI Integration
The plugin integrates with Unreal's UI through:
- Custom menu entries in the Window menu
- Toolbar buttons for editor, build, and error list
- Dockable editor and error list tabs
